# INTRODUCTION 

The project is  on Supermarket  Billing.  
Supermarket is  the place where customers  come  to purchase their daily using products and pay for that. 
So there is a need to calculate how many products are sold and to generate the bill for the customer. 
In our project we have 3 users. First is the data entry operator who will enter the products in database.
Second one is the administrator who  will  decide  the  taxes  and  commissions on  the  products and  can see  the report  of  any product. 
Third one is the bill calculating operator who will calculate the bill and print.
